This is a project about how to give bar owners advices in order to improve their ratings, and give customers a brief guide information 
about bars based on yelp data.  

#### Codes folder: 
Contains two folders, "Shiny" folders contains the R code that we used in shiny app. And "Making Suggestion Table" contains the R code that we used to convert our sentiment data, test p-value data into suggestions. "conver.py" is the python code to read the raw Yelp Data and covert them into csv. "data_cleaning.ipynb" is code for data initial analysis and data cleaning. "sentiment_to_business_test.py" is code for extracting sentiment information from reviews. "word_to_sentiment.py" is code for coverting sentiment information into test information and merging reviews data into business data.  


#### Pic folder:
Contains the images and tables that we produced in our analysis on Yelp Data and our report.

#### Data folder:
