By doing these tests, we can get what features that customers cares about most, and what pros and cons that can improve or decrease stars for a bar (business) most.<br>\n",

For some business, there are very limited number of reviews, so we use 30 as a threshold. For business with more than 30 reviews, if the positive mentions make up to more than 75% of mentions with attitude for a certain key word, then we note it as business with a positive key words, vice versa. For business with reviews fewer than 30, if the positive mentions make up to more than 50% mentions with attitude for a certain key word, then wwe note it as business with a positive key words, vice versa.\n",

    "1. Our recommendation system will tell customers what food or drink is mentioned with positive attitude.\n",
    "2. Our recommendation system will warn customers from ordering food or drink with negative reviews.\n",
    "3. For service part, our recommendation systems will let customers know if there are good or bad waiter/waitress, Wi-Fi, whether there is enough parking lots or not, whether the restroom is nice, if these key words are mentioned in reviews.\n",
    "4. For atmosphere part, our recommendation systems will let customers know if there are good or bad music, band, environment, atmosphere, if these key words are mentioned in reviews.\n",

    "1. Our recommendation systems will let business know whehter there is some positive or negative impression for food from reviews, and from what aspects the business can improve it.\n",

    "#### Pros:\n",
    "1. Our model is concise and robust since we have four tests on each word's significance.\n",
    "2. Our analysis not only compare positive sentiment with negative sentiment, but we also add no sentiment into comparation.\n",
    "3. Our project not only analysis data business-wise but also city-wise.\n",
    "4. The shinny app is very user friendly and beautiful. \n",
    "\n",
